    <p>
        Since my mom adopted me, we've been exploring NYC. One of my favorite places to go is Brooklyn Bridge Park, like in the picture above! 
    </p>

    <p>I've also been working hard at my training. So far I've learned to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sit,</li>
        <li>Lay Down, and</li>
        <li>Shake.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I still drive my mom crazy sometimes though, especially when I:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Bark at the doorbell,</li>
        <li>Eat things off of the street, and</li>
        <li>Wake her up early (I just want to cuddle!). </li>
    </ul>
