        Before I came to Brooklyn, I was living in Puerto Rico, which is home to many <a href="https://thesatoproject.org/what-is-a-sato-dog">satos</a> like me. 
        My mom doesn't know much about what my life was like before she adopted me, but it was probably pretty lonely. Then the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nationalfosterpr/">National Foster Alliance</a> picked me up and and sent me to the United States to live in the big city!
